# Team Violet Project Plan

## Project Idea

We've chosen to develop a Discord-like platform tailored for Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs). The platform will provide social networking features akin to Discord, along with specialized functionalities catering to the needs of tabletop and board game enthusiasts.

## Stack

- **TypeScript**: Utilized throughout the project for type safety and enhanced developer experience.
- **tRPC**: Utilized for type-safe communication between the client and server.
- **Zod**: Used for data validation to ensure data integrity and security.

### External APIs:

### Database

- **PostgreSQL**: Chosen as the database management system for its robustness and reliability.

### Backend & Frontend

- **Next.js**: Used for both backend and frontend development. Next.js provides server-side rendering capabilities, making it suitable for building dynamic web applications with a unified codebase.

### Backend Libraries

- **Prisma ORM**: Leveraged for database operations, providing a type-safe and efficient interface for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
- **Jest / SuperTest**: Employed for unit and integration testing to ensure the reliability of backend functionalities.
- **Winston**: Utilized for logging to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

### Frontend Libraries

- **Vitest / Cypress**: Chosen for testing the frontend components and ensuring their functionality.
- **Tailwind**: Employed for styling and UI components to ensure a sleek and modern user interface.

## Roles

- **Anni**: Full-stack development responsibilities.
- **Joona**: Test automation, end-to-end testing, frontend, and API development.
- **Laura**: Full-stack development responsibilities.
- **Sami**: Full-stack development responsibilities.

This project plan outlines our approach, technology stack, database choice, and team responsibilities for the successful development of the Discord-like platform tailored for TTRPGs using Next.js for both backend and frontend.
